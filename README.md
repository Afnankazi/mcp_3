# Simple Calculator (Python)

A straightforward command-line interface (CLI) calculator application built with Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

*   **Addition:** Add two numbers.
*   **Subtraction:** Subtract one number from another.
*   **Multiplication:** Multiply two numbers.
*   **Division:** Divide one number by another (includes zero division handling).
*   **User-friendly Interface:** Simple menu-driven interaction.
*   **Input Validation:** Handles non-numeric input gracefully.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup Commands

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the project files:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator-py.git
    cd simple-calculator-py
    ```
    (Assuming you would put this in a git repo. For this exercise, just ensure `main.py` and `requirements.txt` are in the same directory.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: For this simple project, `requirements.txt` might be empty as it uses only built-in modules, but it's good practice to include it.)*

## How to Run the Project

With your virtual environment activated, simply run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The calculator will then prompt you to choose an operation.

## How to Run Tests

This project does not include tests as per the requirements.
